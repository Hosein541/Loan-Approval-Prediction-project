## Project Overview
The Loan Approval Prediction project aims to predict whether a loan application will be approved by a bank. This prediction is made by analyzing various factors and information provided by the applicant. The project involves assessing variables such as loan amount, tenure, CIBIL score, education, assets, and other relevant features. The primary objective is to understand the factors that influence loan approval and develop a predictive model to determine the likelihood of loan approval for new applicants. Additionally, the project seeks to enhance customer service by prioritizing applicants who are more likely to have their loans approved.

### Summary and Conclusion

In this project, I focused on predicting loan approval using various data preprocessing techniques and a machine learning model. The steps and methodologies employed are as follows:

1. Data Cleaning:
   - Column and Value Cleanup: Removed spaces from column names and values to ensure consistency and avoid errors during data processing.

2. Data Visualization:
   - Created appropriate visualizations to explore and understand the data patterns and relationships, providing valuable insights into the dataset.

3. Data Standardization and Label Encoding:
   - Performed data standardization to normalize the features.
   - Applied label encoding to convert categorical variables into numerical format.

4. Model Training and Evaluation:
   - Trained an XGBoost (XGB) model on the processed dataset.
   - The model achieved a high accuracy of 98.2%.

These steps ensured a comprehensive analysis and model training process, leading to a highly accurate prediction model for loan approval.
